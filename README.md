# NPM Imported Package Links - a VS Code Extension

[Download from Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MainaWycliffe.view-package-on-npm)

## The Ultimate tool for Developers

This is the ultimate onboarding VS Code extension. When reading code, we
sometimes come across JS/TS packages that are unfamiliar, with this extension,
just hover on the imported package, and you will get information from NPM, about
the current version of the extension being used, with links to the NPM
package,Homepage and Git Repository.

I created this extension to help developers get to important links for a package
all in one place. Want to learn more about a package being utilized in your
codebase, this extension will help you do that efficiently, no need to go
through Google.
