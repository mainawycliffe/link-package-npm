A Visual Studio extension that displays links to NPM, Git Repo (GitHub/GitLab,
etc.) and Homepage for an imported package in javascript and typescript files
on hover.

## Why

I created this extension to help developers get to important links for a package
all in one place. Want to learn more about a package being utilized in your
codebase, this extension will help you do that efficiently, no need to go
through Google.

## How it works

Just hover on an imported npm package and wait as the package links are loaded,
as shown below ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯.
