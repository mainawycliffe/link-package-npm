## Learn more about a package being used in your codebase

NPM has hundreds of thousands of packages, and sometimes we come across packages
that we are not familiar with. This extension helps you learn more about a
package being used in your codebase by providing links to the NPM package,
Homepage, and Git Repository.

NPM Imported Package Lens is the ultimate onboarding VS Code extension. When
reading code, we sometimes come across JS/TS packages that are unfamiliar, with
this extension, just hover on the imported package, and you will get information
from NPM, about the current version of the extension being used, with links to
the NPM package,Homepage and Git Repository.

## How it works

as shown below ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯.
